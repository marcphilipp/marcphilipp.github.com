A little more than a month ago I spoke at the [Entwicklertag](http://entwicklertag.de/) in Karlsruhe about Software Craftsmanship. More precisely, I gave my very first Pecha Kucha on my understanding of the principles and ethics behind it. Along with [several others](http://www.youtube.com/user/andrenaobjects), my talk was recorded and is now available on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oljTjizjKdM).

Since the slides are a little hard to see in the video, I have uploaded them to [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/u/marcphilipp/p/pecha-kucha-software-craftsmanship).
