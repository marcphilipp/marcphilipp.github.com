Recently, we have [released JUnit 4.11](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/blob/master/doc/ReleaseNotes4.11.md) which now uses the latest version of [Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/) (1.3). Being finally able to (easily) use the power of a recent version of the matchers that come with hamcrest-core and hamcrest-library along with JUnit, I have been looking for a decent-looking printable quick reference of available matchers. Since I wasn't able to find any, I have decided to create my own.

I hope it can be of some use for others. Thus, I'm posting it [here](/downloads/posts/2013-01-02-hamcrest-quick-reference/Hamcrest-1.3.pdf). Please let me know whether you find it useful or if you have any suggestions for improvements! Ping me if you want to modify it yourself.
