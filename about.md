I am passionate about developing software striving for both technical exellence and delighted end-users. To me, software craftsmanship is the journey towards this goal. Thus, I strive to be a good software craftsman every day when I work as a software developer in a small team. In addition, I train and coach other developers from time to time.

I share my knowledge and insights with other developers and learn from fellow craftsmen by contributing to open source projects like [JUnit](http://www.junit.org) or [Project Usus](http://projectusus.org) on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/marcphilipp), by speaking at conferences, and by organizing community events like the [XP Days Germany](http://www.xpdays.de).

When I'm not thinking about software (which sometimes really does happen), I spend time with my wife and my kids as well as the rest of my family. You might also find me running in the woods at times. 

In addition, I am interested in typography and visual design. I originally created the [SoCraTes](http://www.socrates-conference.de)/[Softwerkskammer](http://www.softwerkskammer.org) logo. I'm a fan of [Visual Facilitation](http://www.kommunikationslotsen.de/visual-facilitating/) as well. 

If you want to contact me, feel free to write me an email (simply prepend `mail@` to this domain) or ping me on [About.me](http://about.me/marcphilipp) or [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/marcphilipp). I'm also present, though not very active, on [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Marc_Philipp9) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/marcphilipp).
